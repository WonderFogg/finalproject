My Project was to create an app showcasing the work of The Orlando Sisters (that I volunteer at and also keep track of that the History ("Sistory that includes everything from inventory, meeting notes, photos, the works)and create a location list showing all the other World Wide Locations for the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence Order. Like many organization out there - the most common up to date information is generally found on social media. A lot of information including photos can get lost or deleted or may never even be seen.

To date - Iâ€™ve been able to create the main page and links for the most up to date information for Orlando House and including past events since the Order first started in 1977.

In addition to the World Wide Location Map.  Moving forward - The App will allow each House Member to be able to log in using facebook or gmail authentication  and click on their own House Logo and add their information.

It will be added into the official Orlando House website, which I will probably be taking over. 

This project is brought to you today by using 
React, node, HTML, CSS, Word Press, Bootstrap, Google Maps, Github, Fabulous Folder Structure and anxiety.
